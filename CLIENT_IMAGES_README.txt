CLIENT LOGO IMAGES

Please create and add the following image files to the root directory of your website:

1. client1.png
2. client2.png
3. client3.png

These images will be used in the "Our Clients" section of your website, displayed in a single horizontal line.

Recommended specifications:
- Format: High-quality PNG with transparent background
- Size: 200-250px wide
- Resolution: 72-150 DPI
- Color: Original logo colors (they will be displayed on light gray background cards)
- Content: Professional client logos that represent companies you've worked with

The client logos will be displayed on light gray background cards with subtle shadows. This creates a professional and clean appearance while ensuring the logos are clearly visible.

The images should be high-quality and professional to showcase your client relationships and build trust with potential customers.

Until these images are created, the section may not display correctly or may show placeholder text.
